We have used 2 different algorithms for this project : Gossip and Push-Sum

The topologies used were are : 
1) Line topology implemented using Gossip and Push-Sum algorithm, but it is very slow in Push-Sum
2) 2D topology implemented using Gossip and Push-Sum algorithm, but it is very slow in Push-Sum
3) Imperfect 2D topology implemented using Gossip and Push-Sum algorithm
4) Full topology implemented using Gossip and Push-Sum algorithm
